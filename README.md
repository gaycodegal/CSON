# CSON

A format for object representation like JSON, but in binary instead of human readable text. Planned to include support for circular structures.

C++ support currently in Project Cupcake. Will be migrated here once it's polished and circular structural memory management support is implemented.

Note: Circular Structure Support Not yet included due to C++ memory management (I have the math worked out, I just need to find the time to implement it).
